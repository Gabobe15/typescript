public vs private
properties by default are public 
unless used with private keyword 
everything that you create within the class are public unless you write private. which can only be accessed within the class

protected - property can be accessed from the child user but not outside .

** # / private do the same thing. # is used in js while private is found in tsc

in setters there is no return type  


get - getters: get the value
set - setters: update the value
